- Task:
    Given an array of strings, each made up of a combination of letters and
    digits, write the functionality to find and return the largest sum of
    digits within a string.

    Considering a variety of different input arrays, state any assumptions or
    design choices you had to make.

    Notes:
    - Each digit should be considered its own 1-digit number i.e. in the third
    string below 36 is evaluated as 3 and 6 separately.
    - The input arrays can vary in length; however, they will not be larger
    than 10 strings.
    - Strings can vary in length; however, they will not be larger than 12
    characters.

    Example:
    Input - [ "dh7js4jf", "or2rjvn2w", "h1n36mfl", "a7e6fw" ]
    Sums - 11, 4, 10, 13
    Output - 13
